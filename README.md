NLW Journey - Build a trip planner in React Native

This project is part of the NLW Journey, where we build a comprehensive trip planner application using React Native for the mobile application and Node.js for the server. Below are detailed instructions to set up and run both the mobile and server parts of the project.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Expo CLI (for running the React Native project)

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saullopr/nlw_planner_react_native.git
cd nlw_planner_react_native
```

## Mobile Setup
The mobile application is built with React Native and managed by Expo.

## Installing Dependencies
Navigate to the mobile directory and install the necessary dependencies:
```
cd mobile && npm install
```

## Running the Mobile Project
To start the mobile application, run the following command:
```
npx expo start --clear
```
This command will clear the Expo cache and start the Expo development server. You can then use the Expo Go app on your mobile device or an emulator to preview the app.

## Server Setup
The server side of the application is built with Node.js and provides the backend services for the trip planner.

## Installing Dependencies
Navigate to the server directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```
cd server && npm install
```

## Running the Server Project
To start the server, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```
This command will start the server in development mode, which includes features like hot-reloading for easier development.
